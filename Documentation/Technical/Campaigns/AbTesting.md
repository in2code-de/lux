#### A/B testing

This part of the manual describes how to use A/B testing in TYPO3.

##### Functionality

This feature is based on page-wide A/B testing. This means that you have to add additional pages to a current existing
page and configure that page A or B (the new one) should be delivered randomly.

So first of all choose a page that you want to test (this is A). Copy this page, hide it in Navigation and
change only a few things on this page (this is B).

**Tipp:** For a meaningful test result you should consider not to change too much elements between two pages.
If you want to learn if a green or a blue button is clicked more often, don't change anything else then the color of
this specific button.

##### Configuration

If you open page settings in page A for editing properties as an editor, you will see a new tab called "Marketing".
In this tab you can check *A/B testing enabled for this page* to enable A/B tests.

After that you will see some more fields. Add a title, a description and two page records. Page record 1 with title A
and select the current page, that you are editing. Add a title to page record 2 and also select page B.
Read for your first test.

##### Results

Once you have activated A/B tests in page properties, you will see a result in pageoverview:

<img src="../../Images/screenshot_abtesting_pageoverview.png" width="800" />


##### Backend module

In the backend module you will see all active A/B tests with a short overview about their performance.
Buttons allows you to change to edit view of a page or to pageoverview module with that page.


##### Technical notes

###### Enforce a variant

You can simply add a new (or rename an existing) cookie with name `LUXABTEST` and set the value to `A` or `B` etc.

`LUXABTEST=B`

###### Backend User Sections or Frontend Authentication

We already support also A/B Testing in "Backend User Sections" or on pages with "Frontend Authentication".
If you want to use a Testing within such an area, the server itself will read the A or B target with a CURL-request. If
session cookies for frontend or backend login is given, it will be passed in those requests.

Nevertheless the IP address of the user may be different to the server and this is checked from TYPO3 by default.
You can disable this check if you need it:

```
# For calling pages of type "Backend User Sections"
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['lockIP'] = 0;
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['BE']['lockIPv6'] = 0;

# For calling pages of with a frontend authentication
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['lockIP'] = 0;
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['FE']['lockIPv6'] = 0;
```
