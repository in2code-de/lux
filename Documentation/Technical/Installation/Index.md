### Installation

This part of the documentation describes how to install lux to your TYPO3 instance.

#### 1. Requirements

* TYPO3 9.5 or 10.x
* TYPO3 must run in **composer mode**
* PHP 7.2 or higher

#### 2. Installation via composer

Example composer.json file:

```
{
  "require": {
    "php": "^7.4",
    "typo3/cms": "^10.4",
    "in2code/lux": "^9.0",
  }
}
```

Because lux is registered at packagist.org, you can simple do a `composer require in2code/lux` for example to
install the package. Don't forget to activate (e.g. in the extension manager) the extension once it is installed.

**Note:** You need a github user that has access to the private lux repository for an installation of EXT:luxenterprise.

**Note:** Lux itself will also load some other php packages:
* symfony/expression-language for a calculating magic
* whichbrowser/parser to show some information about the user agent
* buchin/google-image-grabber to show an image by email address from google images

| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview: Extension status                       | Just a small overview over the extension.                                                               |
| Basic: Scoring Calculation                       | Define a calculation model for the basic lead scoring.<br>Available variables are - numberOfSiteVisits, numberOfPageVisits, downloads, lastVisitDaysAgo.<br>Note - you should run a commandController (e.g. every night) and calculate the scoring again, if you are using the variable "lastVisitDaysAgo".|
| Basic: Add on pagevisit                          | Categoryscoring: Add this value to the categoryscoring if a lead visits a page of a lux-category        |
| Basic: Add on download                           | Categoryscoring: Add this value to the categoryscoring if a lead downloads an asset of a lux-category   |
| Basic: Add on click on Link Listener             | Categoryscoring: Add this value to the categoryscoring if a lead clicks on a Link Listener link         |
| Basic: PID to save Link Listener records         | Define a PID where the link listener records should be stored (relevant for the editors user rights)    |
| Module: Disable analysis module                  | Toggle the backend module Analysis in general                                                           |

| Module: Disable workflow module                  | Toggle the backend module Workflows in general                                                          |
| Advanced: Disable lux in page overview module    | Toggle the lux analysis or leads box in page module in general                                          |
| Advanced: Pageoverview mode                      | If not disabled, choose between classic leads view or the new analysis view                             |
| Advanced: Disable ckeditor configuration         | Toggle if an automatic ckeditor configuration should be added or not (for email4link feature)           |
| Advanced: Disable ip logging                     | Disable the logging of the visitors IP address                                                          |
| Advanced: Anonymize IP                           | As an alternative to disableIpLogging, you can anonymize the visitors IP-address when saving. The last part of the IP will be anonymized with "***" |
| Advanced: Show render time                       | For an easier debugging all views in backend can be shown with render times                             |
| Advanced: Use cache layer                        | If you are facing performance issues with lux backend modules or with the page overview view (quick analysis), you can cache views (for 24h) when turning the feature on. In addition there is a command that can be executed via scheduler task to warmup caches (e.g. every night) |

#### 3. Add TypoScript

If you have already activated lux in your TYPO3 instance, you can add the static TypoScript file *Main TypoScript (lux)*
in your root template. Most of the TypoScript configuration is used for frontend and for backend configuration.

##### 3a Constants

Look at the default settings of your lux in TypoScript constants:

```
plugin.tx_lux.settings {
  # cat=lux//0010; type=boolean; label= Activate autoenable: Decide if user tracking is turned on by default (no opt-in needed here). If you turn autoenable off, you have to build an opt-in.
  autoenable = 1

  # cat=lux//0020; type=options[0,2]; label= Identification method: Decide if fingerprinting (0) or local storage (2) method should be used for tracking your leads. Both methods have their ups and downs (see documentation for details).
  identificationMethod = 0

  tracking {
    # cat=lux//0030; type=boolean; label= Activate page tracking: (De)Activate tracking of the users pagefunnel.
    page = 1

    # cat=lux//0040; type=boolean; label= Activate download tracking: (De)Activate tracking if the user downloads an asset.
    assetDownloads = 1

    # cat=lux//0050; type=text; label= Activate download tracking: (De)Activate tracking if the user downloads an asset.
    assetDownloads.allowedExtensions = pdf,txt,doc,docx,xls,xlsx,ppt,pptx,zip

    # cat=lux//0060; type=boolean; label= Activate searchterm tracking: (De)Activate tracking searchterms if user searched for someone on your website.
    search = 1
  }

  # cat=lux//0100; type=boolean; label= Activate field and form identification: (De)Activate identification by filling out web forms.
  fieldandformidentification = 1

  # cat=lux//0200; type=boolean; label= Disable for identified: Disable email4link lightbox in frontend if the visitor is already identified.
  disableEmail4DownloadForIdentifiedVisitors = 1

  # cat=lux//0300; type=boolean; label= Disable for backend users: Disable lux tracking in frontend if you are also logged in into backend.
  disableTrackingForBackendUsers = 1

  # cat=lux//0400; type=int+; label= PID privacy page: Set the pid of the privacy page for links in lux forms.
  pidPrivacyPage = 11
}
```

##### 3b Fingerprint or LocalStorage

With the constant `identificationMethod` (see above) you can decide if lux should work in fingerprint or in
localstorage mode. While a fingerprint can be calculated by hardware details automatically, a localstorage mode is
similar to a cookie. We would also don't use `autoenable` if you want to go for local storage and ask your visitors
for an opt-in.

###### Fingerprint for b2b

**Upside:** Fingerprint is calculated automatically and does not need to be stored anywhere on the device
(cookie or local storage). A tracking between different domains and page branches is possible
within the same TYPO3 instance.

**Downside:** To calculate a fingerprint 200-400ms is needed. Beside that multiple visitors with same hard- and software
are recognized as only one visitor. This is especially true for iPhones of the same version and generation.

###### LocalStorage for b2c

**Upside:** If you have a lot of iPhone visitors on your website (e.g. if you own a b2c shop for a younger target
group), you may want to differ between your visitors. So you could go for LocalStorage.
A random string is generated where fast and saved on the visitors device. You can also differ between multiple iPhone
visitors.

**Downside:** You have to ask your visitor if you are allowed to store a random string the local storage of the device,
to identify your visitor. To meet GDPR rules, we would suggest you to set up a cookie banner.
In addition a visitor of domain A is not automatically merged if he also visits domain B on the same TYPO3 instance
(every domain has its own local storage area. Of course if the user is identified on both domains, the profile will be
merged to only one).

If you want to see in detail what kind of TypoScript will be included and how to overwrite some parts, look at
[the Lux folder](../../../Configuration/TypoScript/Lux)

#### 4. Ready to go

lux is now up and running. If you go into the frontend of your webpage and open the browser console, you should see
an asynchronical request to every page request.

<img src="../../../Documentation/Images/documentation_installation_browserrequest.png" width="800" />

**Note:** Take care to be not logged in into your TYPO3-backend at the same time with the same browser
or turn on tracking for BE-Users via TypoScript.

**Note2:** Take care that your browser does not have activated the DoNotTrack (DNT)
setting (Default for FireFox Anonymous Tab)
