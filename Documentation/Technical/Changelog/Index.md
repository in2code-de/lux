| From former versions to 23.0.0 | Signals are migrated to PSR-14 events                        | If you have extended LUX via slots (based in signals), you have to migrate your slots to eventlisteners - see [Events documentation](../Events/Index.md) for details                      |
| From former versions to 21.0.0 | Small change: Marker names in email4link template changed    | If you have overwritten the Email4Link template file, take care to use the "EMAIL4LINK_" prefix now for the 3 variables/markers (###TITLE### => ###EMAIL4LINK_TITLE###)                   |
| From former versions to 17.1.0 | Small change: Disable IP-API.com via Typoscript now          | If you turned off connection to IP-API.com via extension manager settings, you have to do this now via TypoScript - see [documentation](../../../Documentation/Privacy/IpAddresses.md)    |
| From former versions to 8.x    | Referrers are stored on a different place now                | Call your TYPO3 upgrade wizard. There will be one more step that will copy values from _visitor.referrer to _pagevisit.referrer table.                                                    |

| From former versions to 3.x    | The visitor object can handle more cookies now               | After updating use the update button in extension manager of if you have a lot of data stored, you can also use the LuxUpdateCommandController to prevent timeouts                        |
