| From former versions to 35.0.0  | Multiclient usage on some records need some time to work                        | Nothing to do for you - just a note: Some records have to be extended with site information, but this can only be done with new records - not with existing (affected tables: Logs, Search, Fingerprint and some boxes on Lead Dashboard). To ensure that privacy is guaranteed, you need to remove all existing LUX data in a multiclient environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| From former versions to 32.0.0  | Old Flashmessages could be visible in backend views after update                | Nothing to do or to worry about. In the past there were flashmessages like "lead deleted" stored to a backend editor, but there was no output. If you upgrade now to LUX 32 it could happen that all old flashmessages are visible for the editors. Once those messages are shown, they will be deleted - everything is fine again after a reload or switch to a different view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| From former versions to 28.0.0  | Email4link HTML template via AJAX - overwrite `Email4link.html`                 | If you have modified the `Email4Link.html`, this is now done in a similar way. 1. You have to set a template path to your sitepackage like `plugin.tx_lux_email4link.view.templateRootPaths.1 = EXT:mysitepackage/Resources/Private/Templates/Extensions/Lux/` 2. Copy the original file from `EXT:lux/Resources/Private/Templates/Frontend/Email4link.html` to your sitepackage in `EXT:mysitepackage/Resources/Private/Templates/Extensions/Lux/Frontend/Email4link.html` and modify it to your needs. **Please keep in mind that the filename has changed from Email4Link.html to Email4link.html (lowercase 'l' character)** |
