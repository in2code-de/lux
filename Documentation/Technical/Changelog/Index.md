## Breaking changes !!!

| Version                        | Situation                                                 | Upgrade instructions                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From former versions to 26.2.0 | Name of localStorage settings changed                     | Nothing to code, but maybe you have to adjust your privacy note: Local storage settings `luxTrackingOptOut` + `luxTrackingOptIn` were removed. A new name is given `luxTracking`       |
| From former versions to 23.0.0 | Signals are migrated to PSR-14 events                     | If you have extended LUX via slots (based in signals), you have to migrate your slots to eventlisteners - see [Events documentation](../Events/Index.md) for details                   |
| From former versions to 21.0.0 | Small change: Marker names in email4link template changed | If you have overwritten the Email4Link template file, take care to use the "EMAIL4LINK_" prefix now for the 3 variables/markers (###TITLE### => ###EMAIL4LINK_TITLE###)                |
| From former versions to 17.1.0 | Small change: Disable IP-API.com via Typoscript now       | If you turned off connection to IP-API.com via extension manager settings, you have to do this now via TypoScript - see [documentation](../../../Documentation/Privacy/IpAddresses.md) |
| From former versions to 8.x    | Referrers are stored on a different place now             | Call your TYPO3 upgrade wizard. There will be one more step that will copy values from _visitor.referrer to _pagevisit.referrer table.                                                 |
| From former versions to 7.x    | Cookie-Table was replaced with a Fingerprint-Table        | Call your TYPO3 upgrade wizard. There will be one more step that will copy values from _idcookie to _fingerprint table. Note that CommandControllers are replaced by Symfony Commands! |
| From former versions to 3.x    | The visitor object can handle more cookies now            | After updating use the update button in extension manager of if you have a lot of data stored, you can also use the LuxUpdateCommandController to prevent timeouts                     |
