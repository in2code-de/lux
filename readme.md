At the moment it's not possible to use lux without **composer mode**!

## Breaking changes !!!

| Version                        | Situation                                                    | Upgrade instructions                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| From former versions to 17.1.0 | Small change: Disable IP-API.com via Typoscript now          | If you turned off connection to IP-API.com via extension manager settings, you have to do this now via TypoScript - see [documentation](Documentation/Privacy/IpAddresses.md)             |
| From former versions to 8.x    | Referrers are stored on a different place now                | Call your TYPO3 upgrade wizard. There will be one more step that will copy values from _visitor.referrer to _pagevisit.referrer table.                                                    |
| From former versions to 7.x    | Cookie-Table was replaced with a Fingerprint-Table           | Call your TYPO3 upgrade wizard. There will be one more step that will copy values from _idcookie to _fingerprint table. Note that CommandControllers are replaced by Symfony Commands!    |
| From former versions to 3.x    | The visitor object can handle more cookies now               | After updating use the update button in extension manager of if you have a lot of data stored, you can also use the LuxUpdateCommandController to prevent timeouts                        |
