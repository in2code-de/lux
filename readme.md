## Technical requirements

LUX needs minimum *TYPO3 12* in the latest version as a modern backend. TYPO3 must run in *composer mode* for an
easier implementation of third party requirements (php packages) and for easier quality assurance.
Every kind of form extension is supported for the identification feature (powermail, form, formhandler, felogin,
femanager, etc...).
At the moment it's not possible to use LUX without **composer mode**!!!
